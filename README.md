# BOOSTR
BOOSTR (Booster Operation Optimization Sequential Time-Series for Regression) was created to provide cycle-by-cycle time series of readings and settings from instruments and controllable devices of the Booster, the 15~Hz Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) at Fermilab. This is the code associated with the full release.
