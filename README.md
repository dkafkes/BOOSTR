# BOOSTR
BOOSTR (Booster Operation Optimization Sequential Time-Series for Regression) was created to provide cycle-by-cycle time series of readings and settings from instruments and controllable devices of the Booster, the 15~Hz Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) at Fermilab. This is the code associated with the full release. See Zenodo for [all data](https://zenodo.org/record/4382663#.YGNPCq9KhHw) or a [partial release](https://zenodo.org/record/4088982#.YGNQma9KhHw). 

Additionally, see our associated [Data Descriptor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08359.pdf) for an in-depth explanation of how the data was collected and what it represents.

Here we provide an example of how to get started with BOOSTR data (see 'data load example.ipynb') and provide files used in the creation of the dataset for verification purposes.
